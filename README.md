# Tic Tac Toe, C Implementation

More or less a project born out of boredom during the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic.
This is Tic-Tac-Toe, implemented in C, for the sake of keeping my programming skills sharp.

Planned features:

- Command line interface
- Local multiplayer
- Local singleplayer against AI (minimax algorithm)
- GUI interface via GTK+?
- Peer to peer multiplayer (probably not, though)
